# Charged Particle Motion in a Magnetic Field

This Python script simulates the motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field, considering damping effects. It solves the equations of motion using `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` and animates the trajectory in 3D.

## Features
- Uses the Lorentz force equation with damping.
- Integrates motion numerically using `solve_ivp`.
- Generates a 3D animated trajectory using Matplotlib.
